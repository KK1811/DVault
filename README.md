# DVault - A blockchain-based dead man’s switch

•  A digital vault to store user data securely. Data is encrypted using the RSA algorithm and stored in IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). Data can also be transferred/released via an Ethereum smart contract in case of death. Used React along with several specialized Javascript libraries to develop a client application that can encrypt and decrypt files, manage encryption keys, and interact with IPFS and the Ethereum blockchain to store and transfer/release user data. 

•  Tech: Node.js, Express.js, React, Solidity, IPFS
